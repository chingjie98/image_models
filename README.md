# image_models
 Repo of a collection of image models ranging from image classification tasks to more complex object detection in livestream tasks. Main stack would be PyTorch.

Currently, some of my repos are in:<br>
CNN classification tasks: https://github.com/chingjie98/Deep-CNN-Image-Classifier
U-Net segmentation task: https://github.com/chingjie98/U-Net-Image-Segmentation
