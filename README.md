# image_models
 Repo of a collection of image models ranging from image classification tasks to more complex object detection in livestream tasks. Main stack would be PyTorch. 
<br><br>
Currently, some of my <strong>repos</strong> are in:<br>
CNN classification tasks: https://github.com/chingjie98/Deep-CNN-Image-Classifier<br>
U-Net segmentation task: https://github.com/chingjie98/U-Net-Image-Segmentation
<br><br>
Currently in the midst of porting them here to make a whole collection of image models.
